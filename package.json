The code relies on the positioning of each individual file to run, including the images.\r Unfortuantely, this method of opening the website will not run the external libraries, meaning the cool 3D models won't be floating around.\r They will show up once we get the domain up and running, so no need to worry.\r Everything else should be unchanged and work normally.\r ```",

hi andrew :)
If you want to download the website to run it, press the
+ Green Code button
and then press Download ZIP in the menu that pops up!
When the ZIP file is downloaded, extract it and then open the .HTML file with a browser.
To do this, right click on the file in File Explorer, hover over the Open with button, and press your desired browser's icon.
It automatically should open a new tab
- HOWEVER
DO NOT change anything else. The code relies on the positioning of each individual file to run, including the images.
Unfortuantely, this method of opening the website will not run the external libraries, meaning the cool 3D models won't be floating around.
They will show up once we get the domain up and running, so no need to worry.
Everything else should be unchanged and work normally.
